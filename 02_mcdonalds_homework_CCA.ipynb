Their corporate employees don't have time to read every single comment, but they do want to read a subset of comments that they are most interested in. In particular, the media has recently portrayed their employees as being rude, and so they want to review any comments about **rude service** so that they can update their employee training accordingly.\n",

    "To accomplish this, your first sub-task is to **calculate the mean confidence score for each row**, and then store those mean scores in a new column. For example, the confidence scores for the first row are `1.0\\r\\n0.6667\\r\\n0.6667`, so you should calculate a mean of `0.7778`. Here are the suggested steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the [`Series.str.split()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.str.split.html) method, convert the **policies_violated:confidence** column into lists of one or more \"confidence scores\". Save the results as a new DataFrame column called **confidence_list**.\n",
    "2. Define a function that calculates the mean of a list of numbers, and pass that function to the [`Series.apply()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.apply.html) method of the **confidence_list** column. That will calculate the mean confidence score for each row. Save those scores in a new DataFrame column called **confidence_mean**.\n",

       "0  Went through the drive through and ordered a #10 (cripsy sweet chili chicken wrap) without fries- the lady couldn't understand that I did not want fries and charged me for them anyways. I got the wrong order- a chicken sandwich and a large fries- my boyfriend took it back inside to get the correct order. The gentleman that ordered the chicken sandwich was standing there as well and she took the bag from my bf- glanced at the insides and handed it to the man without even offering to replace. I mean with all the scares about viruses going around... ugh DISGUSTING SERVICE. Then when she gave him the correct order my wrap not only had the sweet chili sauce on it, but the nasty (just not my first choice) ranch dressing on it!!!! I mean seriously... how lazy can you get!!!! I worked at McDonalds in Texas when I was 17 for about 8 months and I guess I was spoiled with good management. This was absolutely ridiculous. I was beyond disappointed.   \n",

There are a few helpers taking your orders throughout the drive-thru route and they are the worst. They rush you in placing an order and gets impatient once the order gets a tad bit complicated.  Don't even bother changing your mind oh NO! They will glare at you and snap at you if you want to change something.  I understand its FAST food, but I want my order placed right.

We thought it was a joke at first but when realized it wasn't we said goodbye and they just let us leave. I work in a restaurant and this is by far the worst service I have ever seen. I know it was late and maybe they didn't want to be there but it was completely ridiculous. I think the manager should be fired.   \n",

Out of my last 6 orders they got it right 3 times.  Incidentally, the billing was always correct - they just could not read the order and deliver.  Very frustrating!   \n",

Even though it is still fast food, the service at the drive-thru is the best. They rarely make a mistake and I never see anyone parked in the drive-thru slots where they bring food out because they don't have it ready. So, if you like McDonald's fast food, it doesn't get any better than this.   \n",

       "0  Las Vegas Went through the drive through and ordered a #10 (cripsy sweet chili chicken wrap) without fries- the lady couldn't understand that I did not want fries and charged me for them anyways. I got the wrong order- a chicken sandwich and a large fries- my boyfriend took it back inside to get the correct order. The gentleman that ordered the chicken sandwich was standing there as well and she took the bag from my bf- glanced at the insides and handed it to the man without even offering to replace. I mean with all the scares about viruses going around... ugh DISGUSTING SERVICE. Then when she gave him the correct order my wrap not only had the sweet chili sauce on it, but the nasty (just not my first choice) ranch dressing on it!!!! I mean seriously... how lazy can you get!!!! I worked at McDonalds in Texas when I was 17 for about 8 months and I guess I was spoiled with good management. This was absolutely ridiculous. I was beyond disappointed.   \n",

There are a few helpers taking your orders throughout the drive-thru route and they are the worst. They rush you in placing an order and gets impatient once the order gets a tad bit complicated.  Don't even bother changing your mind oh NO! They will glare at you and snap at you if you want to change something.  I understand its FAST food, but I want my order placed right.

We thought it was a joke at first but when realized it wasn't we said goodbye and they just let us leave. I work in a restaurant and this is by far the worst service I have ever seen. I know it was late and maybe they didn't want to be there but it was completely ridiculous. I think the manager should be fired.   \n",

Out of my last 6 orders they got it right 3 times.  Incidentally, the billing was always correct - they just could not read the order and deliver.  Very frustrating!   \n",

Even though it is still fast food, the service at the drive-thru is the best. They rarely make a mistake and I never see anyone parked in the drive-thru slots where they bring food out because they don't have it ready. So, if you like McDonald's fast food, it doesn't get any better than this.   \n",

    "### Personal Assessment of model performance\n",
    "Overall I am believe the model performed quite well.  After personally inspecting each of the 10 OOS comments, I detemined the model correctly labeled 9 out of 10, providing a roughly 90% TPR and only scoring 4 of the 10 as Rude Service.  The one incorrectly labeled comment does refer to RudeService but it appears to be a review that is also referring to \"OrderProblems\" which appears to have confused the model in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a fairly small OOS sample but I believe the overall perforance does bode well for wider application of the model.  I was particularlly impressed that the model was able to detect the subtetly between different types of negative reviews as well.  For example, row 5 is clearly a negative review, however, it is referring to a separate category of \"Filthy\" and has nothing to do with \"RudeService\".  The model quite rightly showed this too, scoring this particular comment as a only 3.6% likelihood of referring to RudeService despite being quite a negative review overall.  Similarly, for row 8, the comments are mixed with \"positive\" friendly service comments but with \"negative\" comments about \"OrderProblem\" issues.  Again, the model was able to discern between these two and only scored this entry as having a 12% likelihood of referring to \"RudeService.\""
